## Reporting a Vulnerability

For security related issues, please contact <https://github.com/fuzzzerd> directly with detailed information regarding the vulnerability or explot. If you have an associated change/fix, please include a .patch file or a description of how it can be fixed. If you'd like to open a PR with a fix that is also great, provided that does not directly expose an explit.
