# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! As an open source project, any help we can get fixing bugs or adding features is always appreciated. In all cases, PRs will be reviewed with an eye toward future maintainability, so things like good comments, unit test coverage, and thorough design are importat considerations. If you decide to work on a bug or feature from our issue list, please be prepared to work through design or maintenance issues in the PR.

## Features

Please open an issue discussing your idea prior to beginning work on a pull request. We want to make sure that any work is directed in a way that is likely to be merged into master and ultimately shipped. Since any new feature adds maintenance effort, we have to be judicious with the features we accept.

## Bugs

If you have found a bug, please open an issue! If you have a fix, we'd love for you to include a PR that addresses the issue.
